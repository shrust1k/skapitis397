                <h1>Peaceful times</h1>
                <span class="text-info">In the bustling halls of RV1G, 
                    two comrades, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shrust1k_?igsh=Z2l4N2o3NW94enhr&utm_source=qr">Max</a> and 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/janis.ceplis?igsh=MWpraGsyODdjeTdseQ== ">Yanis</a>,
                     held the key to a closet brimming with secrets. 
                    Within its humble confines, they stashed their clothing, sports gear, and the
                     occasional <strike>snus</strike> snack. But their world took a delicious turn when fate led them
                      to shelter another soul: 
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/normuns?igsh=aTgwZHlrc294MXg3">Normund</a>, a hero armed with chocolate.

                <span class="text-info">
                    Normund's arrival brought a new dimension to their lives. No longer content
                     with mere mundanity, their days were punctuated by whispered conversations
                      and daring escapades. Amidst the chaos of school life, they forged a bond stronger 
                      than steel, united by their shared adventures and the sweetness of Normund's chocolatey treasures.

                <span class="text-info">  
                    Every first break, like clockwork, the trio would retreat to their sanctuary, 
                    leaving their jackets behind in the closet as a testament to their camaraderie. 
                    Together, they navigated the trials and tribulations of adolescence, finding solace
                     in each other's company and the sanctuary of their beloved closet.

                    Though the world outside may have been fraught with uncertainty, close to their closet
                     , they found respite from the storm. And so, as they faced the challenges that 
                     lay ahead, Max, Yanis, and Normund: The Closet Guardians stood shoulder to shoulder, ready to confront
                      whatever destiny had in store.

            <h1>Period of dawn</h1>
            <span class="text-info">
            During the heyday of the closet's dawn, its significance transcended mere storage; it became 
            a hub of innovation and community at RV1G. When the treasure trove of
             chocolates within its confines equaled a modest 30 euros, Max and Normund stumbled upon a stroke
              of brilliance: a microwave. With ingenuity and determination, they transformed their humble 
              closet into something more—a cozy nook where warmth and friendship flourished.
            </span>
            <span class="text-info">
            Max, ever the craftsman, fashioned a sturdy table for the microwave, ensuring it stood as a beacon of 
            possibility amidst the chaos of school life. Together, they envisioned a grander purpose for their newfound 
            appliance, one that would extend beyond their own enjoyment.
             </span>
            <span class="text-info">
            With entrepreneurial spirit, they opened their closet-turned-cafeteria to the school community, offering
            delectable treats and warm beverages to weary students and teachers alike. Word of their endeavor spread 
            like wildfire, drawing patrons from all corners of the gymnasium.
        </span>
            <span class="text-info">
            In the quiet moments between classes, laughter echoed within the walls of their makeshift café, and friendships
            blossomed over steaming cups of cocoa and freshly microwaved snacks. The closet became more than just a place 
            to store jackets and sports gear; it became a sanctuary, a refuge from the rigors of academic life.

            <h1>Great war</h1>
            <span class="text-info">
                But before Freiberg's nefarious deeds, another adversary emerged: Sauron, the janitor of the gymnasium. 
                With a broom in hand and a scowl upon her face, she thwarted Closet Guardian' attempts to launch their café business.
                 Her vigilant eye and strict adherence to order proved to be a formidable obstacle, denying them the opportunity to 
                 bring warmth and camaraderie to their fellow students.</span>
             <span class="text-info">
                As if by cruel twist of fate, Freiberg seized upon the chaos sown by Sauron's interference. With a savage cunning, 
                he and his band of orcs infiltrated the school, their eyes set on the prized microwave within the closet. In a brazen 
                display of power, Freiberg tore the microwave from its rightful place, leaving Max, Yanis, and their allies powerless 
                to stop him.</span>
            <span class="text-info">
                To compound their misfortune, some of Freiberg's minions, in their insatiable greed, ransacked the cafeteria, absconding with every
                 last morsel of chocolate. The once-abundant supply dwindled to nothing, leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of 
                 those who had once sought solace in its sweetness.</span>
            <span class="text-info">And so, amidst the clamor of war drums and the clash of steel, a period of great strife 
                descended upon RV1G. The once-vibrant halls fell silent, consumed by the shadow of 
                impending doom. In the face of overwhelming adversity, the fate of the school hung in the balance, teetering 
                on the brink of oblivion.</span>

            <h1>What's now?</h1>
            <span class="text-info">
                As the trials of RV1G unfolded, the future of The Closet Guardians remained uncertain.
                Amidst the chaos of orc invasions and the loss of their cherished treasures, the path ahead seemed shrouded
                 in mystery. No one could predict how their story would unfold, for it was as unpredictable as the swirling 
                 currents of fate itself. As they faced the challenges of the present, the fate of The Closet Guardians remained 
                 a tantalizing enigma, their destiny yet to be written.
